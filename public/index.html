      This site isn't super interesting. I mean, unless you really love staring
      at a paragraph of completely unstyled HTML. More than likely you typed an
      incorrect short code, so you didn't wind up where you wanted to be. Why
      not stare at this paragraph for a bit and then consider your life decisions
      that led you here. Okay, that's enough. You can close this page now.
